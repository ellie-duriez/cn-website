    <p>Hello! I'm Ellie. I'm a hobby artist based in the north of England. I have been interested in art and design for most of my life, and several times did even consider persuing it as a career, however found that it was something I prefered to keep as an interest as I dislike the stress that comes with a job in the creative field, and the joy this saps out of what is something I do to relax. I am a lover of all things creative and always up for experimenting with new mediums. I don't have 'one' working method. I work both traditionally (pencils, paints and pens), digitally (I use a small bamboo wacom tablet), and also work with 3D mediums to create props and costume. I alternative between these working methods, and often combine them to create the desired effect! </p>

    My life experience and my passions all drive me and contribute to my working style, and this is in a constant state of flux. I am always growing and developing. Detailed below are just a few of my influences.
    
    Having spent most of my life anchored to an urban environment, nature at it's best is sadly not something I've had the opportunity to experience as much of as I'd like to. However growing up, I was lucky enough to get to spend months each year in and around rural France. It was in the french countryside that my affection and respect for nature, animals and insects really grew, and it's something that's now undoubtedly at the core of everything I do and love.

    My love of animals means I have always been drawn to films such as 'The Plague Dogs', 'Watership Down', 'Brother Bear', 'Spirit', and 'The Lion King', as well as theatre productions such as 'Cats' and 'War Horse'. When I was younger, I was absolutely enthralled by a book series called 'Warrior Cats', which is what first inspired me to make animations, and therefore kickstart my interest in combining all things creative with my passion for animals. Since then, video games have also had their impact on my work. The games I love the most are usually more of the indie vein, and those containing thought provoking and humanitarian driven narratives such as 'This War of Mine' and 'Papers Please'.
