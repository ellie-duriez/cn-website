    <h3>Availability and Pricing</h3>
  </div>

  <p>I am generally not available for commissions, however I am happy to discuss what you have in mind and if it's a project that particuarlly interests me I might accept the odd piece of commission work. Below is a non-exhaustive list of the types of work I am most versed with:</p>
  <ul><li>Pet portraits</li><li>Pet models and sculptures</li><li>Creature designs</li><li>Pixel artwork</li><li>Poseable animal dolls</li><li>Costume parts</li></ul>
  <p>Please note that these are just my main areas of specialism where I have the most experience. I would love to work on new mediums and technologies and I may even offer this at a discounted price if it's something unfamiliar to me.
     Pricing normally is on a case by case basis, as every piece of artwork I create is so different and completely bespoke. I base my prices off time, materials, and skill involved.
